								<h2><a href="#books"> All the Books I read in 2021, Plus My Thoughts </h2>
								<h3>Since June 2020, I've gotten into reading as a hobby. I was inspired to create
					        this blog from reading other blogs. Some for inspiration to start your own: UC Berkeley
					        Computer Science Ph.D. student Daniel Seita's
					        (https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2021/01/01/books-2020).
					        My Goodreads account for reference: https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112758134-edward-sun

								<h3>Thinking, Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman</h3>
								<p>
										What a heavy read - this took me almost 3 weeks to get through - I was also distracted
										by the quarter ending and work picking up. There were a lot of good ideas in here, all mainly
										centered around how we know less than we think we know and how our mind tricks us into
										thinking that we make logical decisions.
										Kahneman uses a two systems framework to explain why - we have a "System 1" that's in charge
										of fast intuitive decisions, and a backup "System 2" that handles slower, more critical thinking.
										System 1 is the source of our "intuition", i.e. our associative memory and skill acquisition, but
										also the source of errors and biases (intensity matching, associative coherence, nonregressive
										predictions, etc.). The middle section of the book described how irrational humans are in judging
										probability and expectations - boring and read like a stats textbook, generally unpleasant.
										I almost wanted to give up but the best part of the book came near the end, where he explained the
										difference between the experiencing self and the remembering self. Cognitive errors like duration
										neglect and the peak-end rule can lead the remembering self to categorize painful experiences
										as happy ones. This is something I've thought about a lot but never had the vocabulary to
										express it, so I'm glad I held through to the end. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who's interested
										in decision theory and psychology but definitely block out some time to get through it.

								<h3>23 Things They Don’t Tell You About Capitalism - Ha-Joon Chang</h3>
								<p>I read this as a recommendation from a good friend of mine who is much more well-read than me on
            economics. I don't think I have a foundation to disagree intelligently with some of the points,
            but I learned a lot of new things. The main thesis of Chang's book is that free-market economists have got it wrong.
            Increased government intervention and in the form of more regulations can actually work. The financial sector moves much faster
            than the "real" sector - think of higher-order derivatives that led to the Great Recession in 2008.
            Even though the government might not know better than the top decision-makers of financial firms, more regulation can
            successfully limit the complexity of the activities, preventing similar crises in the future.
            The free-market often leads to increased inequality and job insecurity, and even
            worse, rich countries who want to implement free market policies in developing nations forget that
            they themselves grew from protectionist policies and used state-owned enterprises to promote industry.
            Chang gives the example of Britain's industrial dominance in the woollen manufacturing industry in the
            mid-eighteenth century - the resulting export earnings were reinvested in importing raw materials it
            needed to launch the Industrial Revolution. Basically, state industrial policy and protectionism,
            things that conventional economics says can't work, actually can. This book reminded me of Freakonomics
            at some points in how real-life the examples were - at one point, Chang argues that in terms of time saved,
            the washing machine changed the world more than the internet.
            One thing I found interesting is that few corporations are actually trans-national - most still have
            the majority of their R&D and higher level operations in their home countries.</p>

						<h3> Tribe - Sebastian Hunger</h3>
						<p>
			      War isn’t all bad - disasters can create a community of sufferers that allow individuals to feel closer to others. Junger gives a few examples of Shawnee and Delaware tribes that enticed English settlers away from their societies and argues that values like group cohesion and selflessness are markedly absent in modern society, leading to increased feelings of loneliness and depression. Interestingly, PTSD from war is both treatable and usually not chronic. I thought it was interesting that he argued that lifelong disability payments without programs for reintegrating veterans into American society are turning them into a victim class that’s dependent on the government for their livelihood. Overall, I think he’s correct that modern society has made us wealthier and more individualistic but probably also more depressed than our tribal ancestors - I’ve been feeling that a lot especially during quarantine.
						</p>
						<h3> Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari </h3>
						<p>
		        Harari is great at breaking down complex ideas into simple concepts but sometimes reading him is like watching the scientist from the movie The Dictator in that scene where he explains how a nuclear bomb works to the King of Wadiya. He spends almost half a chapter giving different examples of how money doesn't have any inherent value - I was frustrated. I agree with the main points of his book (that religion, money and empires are all unifiers of humankind, because they exist in our collective human imagination).
		        An interesting thing I learned is that speakers of the Indo-European language (around 3000 years ago) were called Aryans. Some of them invaded India and intermarried with the local race and the rest went to Europe to become Greeks, Romans, Gothics. These European Aryans preserved their racial purity so that's why Europeans managed to conquer the world - this theory was used to justify European and Aryan superiority.
		        I also read Homo Deus (human cyborg AI!!1! Bad news) and 21 Lessons for the 21st century (terrorism bad, meditation good), sometimes my brain is on autopilot reading him- his writing style is entertaining and easy to understand, I can see why he's a NYT best-selling author.

		        Notable quotes - "A dramatic increase in the collective power and ostensible success of our species went hand in hand with much individual suffering"
			      </p>
			      <h3> When Breath Becomes Air - Paul Kalanithi </h3>
			      <p>
			        I took this recommendation from a friend but was concerned that it might not be the right thing to read given the current state of the world today. Although it is about a man dying of lung cancer, it's more about hope than anything else - I could tell how determined he was to find and convey the meaning of his life story.
			        My favorite quote: "You can't ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving"
			      </p>

			      <h3> The Biggest Bluff - Maria Konnikova </h3>
			      <p>
			        I first heard of Konnikova from a Freakonomics podcast episode and was immediately drawn to her story of how she went from a novice to a poker pro in two years. I played a bit in college so I was able to understand most of the jargon used. Konnikova describes how her unique background, with a PhD in psychology and a body of work in human behavior, brought a fresh perspective to a game commonly thought to be governed by statistics and cold calculations. Her identity as a woman in a man's game reminded me of Queen's Gambit, a show I watched recently where the main character faces a similar situation. Interesting thing I learned was that she played against Loek Van Wely, a chess grandmaster at the 2018 PokerStars Caribbean Adventure (PCA).
